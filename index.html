<p>You have stumbled on my homepage! I am a Sotware Engineer at Apple Inc. working on Machine Translation <i>(Fun Fact: Siri can translate!)</i>. I am interested in Machine Translation and Machine Learning in general.
Before this I have had the pleasure of spending time at amazing Computer Science departments at <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in"> Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu"> Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
<p>In my spare time, I like to play tennis, watch netflix, drink coffee, play board games or go for a hike.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I have worked on:</p>

<p><i>Barun Patra, Joel Ruben Antony Moniz, Sarthak Garg, Matthew R. Gormley, Graham Neubig, The 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). July 2019.</i></p>
        <p>Recent work on bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) has frequently depended either on aligned bilingual lexicons or on distribution matching, often with an assumption about the isometry of the two spaces. We propose a technique to quantitatively estimate this assumption of the isometry between two embedding spaces and empirically show that this assumption weakens as the languages in question become increasingly etymologically distant. We then propose Bilingual Lexicon Induction with Semi-Supervision (BLISS) --- a semi-supervised approach that relaxes the isometric assumption while leveraging both limited aligned bilingual lexicons and a larger set of unaligned word embeddings, as well as a novel hubness filtering technique. Our proposed method obtains state of the art results on 15 of 18 language pairs on the MUSE dataset, and does particularly well when the embedding spaces don't appear to be isometric. In addition, we also show that adding supervision stabilizes the learning procedure, and is effective even with minimal supervision. <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1018">Paper</a>,<a href="https://github.com/joelmoniz/BLISS">Code</a></p>

        <p>Me and Aayush Ojha are working on improving the circuit upper bound for Bipartite Matching in planar grid graphs from ACC<sub>0</sub> to AC<sub>0</sub>. Recently Hansen, Komarath et. al. reduced bipartite matching in grid graphs to the monoid word problem. This problem reduces to proving the nonexistence of a periodic path in the shifted superposition of any perfect matching in a grid graph with itself. We have been able to prove the hypothesis for these subcases</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Nonexistence of a periodic path which is peice-wise monotone in the y direction.</li>
          <li> Nonexistence of a periodic path which enters the topmost and bottommost layer of the grid graph at least once.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have used parity based arguments to prove these results. We aim to generalize the proofs without any restriction on the path</p>

        <p>Pushdown systems accurately model the control flow of first order recursive programs (like those written in C and Java), and lend themselves readily to algorithmic analysis. I researched extensively the class of saturation algorithms which compute whether some error states in a pushdown system are reachable or not. Recently Clemente, Parys, Salvati and Walukiewicz introduced Ordered Tree Pushdown Systems (OTPS), which subsume several classes of pushdown systems. Clemente et. al. developed an algorithm for deciding the reachability problem. We aim to extend it to compute any &mu; modal calculus denotation along the lines of M. Hague and C.-H.L. Ong's works.</p>

        <p>We implemented an object detector and classifier for detecting people, motorcycles, three wheelers and four wheelers in the institute's traffic surveillance video feed.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> We extracted regions of interest from the video using image processing algorithms and refined then using NMS(non maximal supression) algorithm on a pyramid of gaussians built on the subframes of the initial regions.</li>
          <li> We experimented with different feature representations of images like Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT) for training the classifiers. We achieved a classification accuracy of 88.8% using Linear SVC anf HOG feature representation.</li>
          <li> We also tested a preexisting object detection framework Faster R-CNN based on convolutional networks (Developed by Shaoqiong Ren) on the project dataset.</li>

        <p>I along with Drishti Wali and Sai Kishan Pampana studied the computational complexity class Distributional NP and explored whether or not the existence of problems in NP which have no polynomial time heuristic algorithms can be related to the BPP contains NP question.</p>
        <p>We studied the paper titled 'On worst case to average case reductions for NP problems' by Luca Trevisan and Andrej Bogdanov and gave a class seminar presenting their ideas and approach.</p>

        <p>I along with Prakhar Jawre, Avishek Nath and Shashank Bhushan developed an interactive computer interface in the form of a motorized mechanical arm mounted with a Raspberry Pi, a camera and a projector.</p>
        <p>We applied image processing algorithms (Blob Detection and Contour Detection) using OpenCV to track a laser pointer which was used as a medium to interact with the projection. Postional feedback was sent to an Arduino unit which controlled the movement of a mechanical arm.</p>
