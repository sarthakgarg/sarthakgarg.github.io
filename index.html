<p>You have stumbled on my homepage! I am a final year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at IIT Kanpur. I am broadly interested in Algorithm Design, Graph Theory, Data Mining and Complexity Theory. Below are some of my projects</p>

        <p>I along Aayush Ojha are working on improving the circuit upper bound for Bipartite Matching in planar grid graphs from ACC0 to AC0. Recently Hansen, Komarath et. al reduced bipartite matching in grid graphs to the monoid word problem. This problem reduces to proving the nonexistence of a periodic path in the shifted superposition of any perfect matching in a grid graph with itself. We have been able to prove the hypothesis for these subcases</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Nonexistence of a periodic path which is peice-wise monotone in the y direction.</li>
          <li> Nonexistence of a periodic path which enters the topmost and bottommost layer of the grid graph at least once.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We aim to generalize the proofs without any restriction on the path</p>

<a id="Undergraduate-project-2" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extending Saturation Algorithms for Ordered Tree Pushdown Systems</h3>

        <p>Pushdown systems accurately model the control flow of first order recursive programs (like those written in C and Java), and lend themselves readily to algorithmic analysis. I researched extensively the class of saturation algorithms which compute whether some error states in a pushdown system are reachable or not. Recently Clemente, Parys, Salvati and Walukiewicz introduced Ordered Tree Pushdown Systems (OTPS), which subsume several classes of pushdown systems. Clemente et al. developed an algorithm for deciding the reachability problem. We aim to extend it to compute any mu modal calculus denotation along the lines of M. Hague and C.-H.L. Ong's works</p>

        <p>We implemented an object detector and classifier for detecting people, motorcycles, three wheelers and four wheelers in institute's traffic surveillance video feed</p>
        <ul>
          <li> We extracted regions of interest from the video using image processing algorithms and refined then using NMS(non maximal supression) algorithm on a pyramid of gaussians built on the subframes of the initial regions</li>
          <li> We experimented with different feature representations of images like Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT) for training the classifiers. We achieved a classification accuracy of 88.8% using Linear SVC anf HOG feature representation</li>
          <li> We also tested a preexisting object detection framework Faster R-CNN based on convolutional networks (Developed by Shaoqiong Ren) on the project dataset</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I along with Drishti Wali and Sai Kishan Pampana studied the computational complexity class Distributional NP and explored whether or not the existence of problems in NP which have no polynomial time heuristic algorithms can be related to the BPP contains NP question.</p>
        <p>We studied the paper titled 'On worst case to average case reductions for NP problems' by Luca Trevisan and Andrej Bogdanov and gave a class seminar presenting their ideas and approach</p>

        <p>I along with Prakhar Jawre, Avishek Nath and Shashank Bhushan developed an interactive computer interface in the form of a motorized mechanical arm mounted with a Raspberry Pi, a camera and a projector</p>
        <p>We applied image processing algorithms (Blob Detection and Contour Detection) using OpenCV to track a laser pointer which was used as a medium to interact with the projection. Postional feedback was sent to an Arduino unit which controlled the movement of a mechanical arm</p>

        <p>We built a code management website mainly focused on competitive programming using Django for backend and bootstrap3 for frontend. The website allows for private and public code sharing, annotating and searching algorithmic problems</p>

        <p>As part of Compilers course project, we built a Scala to x86 assembly compiler with support for basic datatypes, conditional statements, looping statements, arrays, typechecking, basic type inference, nested functions and recursion</p>
